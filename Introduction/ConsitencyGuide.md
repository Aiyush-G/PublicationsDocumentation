When you put your article into InDesign **IT MUST BE CONSISTENT** with the rest of the magazine. If you follow the reporters guide and the templates provided, it is the easiest thing in the world. It is a 3 stage process in which you open a template, replace the title, replace the image and replace the body text for the article you are covering. Here are the things you MUST check you have done: 

| 1   | Use one of the templates [here](https://agsfb.sharepoint.com/sites/publications2/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Fpublications2%2FShared%20Documents%2FThe%20Word%2FThe%20Word%20Templates)  | âœ“  |
