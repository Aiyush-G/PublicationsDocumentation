- During meetings, you may be assigned to do an article on an upcoming event. However, if you know of something that is going on, then please do not hesitate in assigning yourself, just let Mr Williams know by email. 
- When you are assigned a task, you must be there to take the photographs or arrange for another photographer to do the job. You must also update the planner to show who is responsible for the task. 
- **You must ensure you have good images** Check them on the mini screen while you are doing the task.   
- Select the pictures you want for the article and edit them in Photoshop. Auto Tone, Auto Contrast and Auto Colour. If the changes don’t look right CTRL Z will undo the step. 
- Upload the images to the appropriate folder (Do not upload every picture, but just a selection of the best ones) on the O365. E.g December 2016 > Images. YOU MUST **Ensure images are renamed identical to the article they go with**. (E.g. not P1060370, But ‘Sports Day 1’.) 
- Email Mr. Williams and the assistant editors to let them know you have completed the article. 
- Update the planner to say your task is complete.
