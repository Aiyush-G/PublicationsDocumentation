Here is how you go about doing an article for the magazine. 
- During meetings, you may be assigned to do an article on an upcoming event. However, if you know of something that is going on, then please do not hesitate in assigning yourself to do an article, add yourself to the planner and just let Mr Williams know by email. 
- When you are assigned an article, you will have two weeks after the event to complete it. 
- You either write the article yourself or get someone (possibly a teacher) who participated in the event to write it for you. This will be in a Microsoft Word format. There will be a responsibility on you to read through your article, so that there are no glaring errors. The articles need to be of a certain standard and read well.  
- **You must ensure you have appropriate images to go with the articles**	 (You are responsible for sourcing photographers if needed) 
- Share the Microsoft Word format article with Mr Williams, AND with the proof reader. Proofreader@agsb.co.uk. It is your responsibility to check that this has been amended. 
- Once proof read, it is time to put it in to an InDesign format. For this, please use an appropriate template provided on O365. Please use past articles as a guide, if yours doesn’t look like one that is already in the magazine, it won’t go in.  
- Upload the InDesign article to the appropriate folder on the O365. E.g December 2018 > Finished InDesign Articles 
- Upload the images to the appropriate folder on O365. E.g December 2018 > Images. **Images must be named same as their article** (E.g. not P1060370 etc.) 
- Email Mr. Williams and the assistant editors to let them know you have completed the article. 
- Update the planner to say your article is finished.
