## Salford Keys 
### Y9 Geography Trip 
 
On the 20th and 22nd of October, **Y9 (Year groups should be written Year 9)** went to Salford Quays to investigate the regeneration of Salford Quays since the closure of the Manchester Ship Canal which rapidly improved economy there. The trip was led by Mr Bromley. Y9 spent a day there evaluating how successful the regeneration had been (field work). This included looking at new museums and shopping malls such as The Lowry. It was a convenient one day trip so it meant that they could miss a whole day of school! An added bonus! 
 
Their geography enquiry included a day tour (by the teachers obviously!) of landmarks in Salford Quays and judging what the age groups would use the facilities available there. All this information was recorded in a booklet that they could use to do their assessment on regeneration after half-term. Luckily, it wasnâ€™t all boring, they were allowed to go on their own to other places to explore the area. Furthermore, there were many restaurants there such as Pizza Hut which many of them went to for lunch. 
 
Finally, the fun ended as we had to go to back to school. They were allowed to use their phones on the way back which make the return journey enjoyable! All that was left was the assessment!
