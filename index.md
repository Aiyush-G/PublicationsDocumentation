## Welcome to AGSB Publications Committee Mentoring

🚀 🐼

Hi there, you must be new, or just looking to brush up on your skills? A list of the mentor tasks which you can do with your mentor to help you learn the required skills can be found on Office 365. You will be set a task to do and the date it must be completed by. This will be arranged with your mentor. Once you have completed it provide evidence to Mr Williams by sharing your document via your one drive. Get your mentor to sign the verified box in your booklet. It is your responsibility to contact your mentor to get help with the tasks.
