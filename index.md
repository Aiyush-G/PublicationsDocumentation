## Welcome to AGSB Publications Committee Mentoring

🚀 🐼

Heya there, you must be new, or just looking to brush up on your skills! A list of the mentor tasks which you can do with your mentor to help you learn the required skills can be found on Office 365. You will be set a task to do and the date it must be completed by, this will be done by your mentor. Once you have completed it, you must provide evidence to Mr Williams or the Assistant Editors (by email or other means) and get them to sign the verified box. It is your responsibility to contact your mentor to get help with the tasks.
