## Reporting a Vulnerability

Create an issue, describe what the vunerability is including as much information as possible. This could include a screenshot and MUST have a list of steps to reproduce that issue / vulnerability.
You should also add the appropriate tag to the question and if possible suggest how it could be fixed.
